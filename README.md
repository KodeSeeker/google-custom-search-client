# Google Custom Search Client Library

Google offers an API for their [Custom Search][1]. However I find the [Java library they provided][2] is difficult to use and there is no sample of usage provided. After several attempts I gave up and decided to create my own.


## Building The Library

Before building the library, make sure that your machine has maven2 environment set up. Build the library with maven command:

	mvn clean install
